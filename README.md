# Clustering--based--density--peaks
A clustering algorithms  by fast search and find of density peaks

# Original Paper from Science
《Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks》

# Including
This cluster repository included a data set named `rawdata.dat` and a algorithm to cluster those data.Raw sample distribution like the letf picture below.

From the right picture,we can set k as 5,and look at the right picture below,the cluster result is pretty good.

What's more,I also add something new to this algorithm it's working on image clustering like K-means.

# Executing
All codes of this cluster algorithm written by MATLAB, and my code included many annotations, just follow the code and those detailed annotations.
